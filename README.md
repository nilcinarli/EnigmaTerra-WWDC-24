Much like “Sudoku”, each row and each column must contain only one skyscraper of any height. Based on the informations, users have to fill in the white boxes with numbers from 1 to N. This helps you figure out the height of each apartment in the NxN grid in order to solve the whole puzzle. Every Puzzle can be solved by logical deduction, no guessing required.
